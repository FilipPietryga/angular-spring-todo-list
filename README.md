A simple fullstack web application representing a simple todo-list with a list of tasks in Angular Frontend with Spring Boot Backend.

This simple application displays usage of both Angular and Spring Boot technologies.

The Spring Boot (backend) part is being represented by the MVC architecture with Service, Component and Model and Repository classes, utilizing the H2 database storing tasks introduced by the user.

The Angular Part represent basic frontend with routing functionality and with Service, Components and Model classes. The frontend part communicates with backend that is hosted locally.

I have also introduced the logging mechanism, tested the communication between instances of backend & frontend and introduced styling to the application.
